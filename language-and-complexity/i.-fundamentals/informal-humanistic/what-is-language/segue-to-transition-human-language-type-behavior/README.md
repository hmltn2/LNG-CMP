# Segue to/transition: "human language-type behavior"

In contrast with a history of attempted formal defintiosn of what a "language" might be, which dissolve above, atop a staircase, increasingly into an ehter of formalism which becomes philosophical, intractible and more diffiult to grasp, we contrast with / coin a term HLTB, to idicate cealry teh physical, social, relational aspect of what most humasn recogniye as an endowed attribute they have, even if its hard to find a definition that suits perfectly - because we dong yet know what it is. Ipso facto. we are trying to talk about soemthing but we dont know what it is - or if its there. (picture of a vague, blrury shapre, clodu fo fog ro smoke or smog or din in london, dickensian, etc., for example).. grounded as a _behavioral_ science..... (???)
